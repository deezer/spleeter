## About

**Spleeter** is [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) source separation library with pretrained models
written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/). It makes it easy
to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides
already trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation :

* Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation ([2 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-2stems-model))
* Vocals / drums / bass / other separation ([4 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-4stems-model))
* Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation ([5 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-5stems-model))

2 stems and 4 stems models have [high performances](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/Separation-Performances) on the [musdb](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) dataset. **Spleeter** is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.

We designed **Spleeter** so you can use it straight from [command line](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#usage)
as well as directly in your own development pipeline as a [Python library](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/4.-API-Reference#separator). It can be installed with [pip](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-pip) or be used with
[Docker](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image).

### Projects and Softwares using **Spleeter**

Since it's been released, there are multiple forks exposing **Spleeter** through either a Guided User Interface (GUI) or a standalone free or paying website. Please note that we do not host, maintain or directly support any of these initiatives.

That being said, many cool projects have been built on top of ours. Notably the porting to the *Ableton Live* ecosystem through the [Spleeter 4 Max](https://github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max#spleeter-for-max) project.

**Spleeter** pre-trained models have also been used by professional audio softwares. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

* [iZotope](https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/rx-8-standard.html) in its *Music Rebalance* feature within **RX 8**
* [SpectralLayers](https://new.steinberg.net/spectralayers/) in its *Unmix* feature in **SpectralLayers 7**
* [Acon Digital](https://acondigital.com/products/acoustica-audio-editor/) within **Acoustica 7**
* [VirtualDJ](https://www.virtualdj.com/stems/) in their stem isolation feature
* [Algoriddim](https://www.algoriddim.com/apps) in their **NeuralMix** and **djayPRO** app suite

üÜï **Spleeter** is a baseline in the ongoing [Music Demixing Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021)!

## Spleeter Pro (Commercial version)

Check out our commercial version : [Spleeter Pro](https://www.deezer-techservices.com/solutions/spleeter/). Benefit from our expertise for precise audio separation, faster processing speeds, and dedicated professional support. 

## Quick start

Want to try it out but don't want to install anything ? We have set up a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter.ipynb).

Ready to dig into it ? In a few lines you can install **Spleeter**  and separate the vocal and accompaniment parts from an example audio file.
You need first to install `ffmpeg` and `libsndfile`. It can be done on most platform using [Conda](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-conda):

```bash
# install dependencies using conda
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg libsndfile
# install spleeter with pip
pip install spleeter
# download an example audio file (if you don't have wget, use another tool for downloading)
wget https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/raw/master/audio_example.mp3
# separate the example audio into two components
spleeter separate -p spleeter:2stems -o output audio_example.mp3
```

> :warning: Note that we no longer recommend using `conda` for installing spleeter.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è There are known issues with Apple M1 chips, mostly due to TensorFlow compatibility. Until these are fixed, you can use [this workaround](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/607#issuecomment-1021669444).

You should get two separated audio files (`vocals.wav` and `accompaniment.wav`) in the `output/audio_example` folder.

For a detailed documentation, please check the [repository wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation)

## Development and Testing

This project is managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/), to run test suite you
can execute the following set of commands:

```bash
# Clone spleeter repository
git clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter && cd spleeter
# Install poetry
pip install poetry
# Install spleeter dependencies
poetry install
# Run unit test suite
poetry run pytest tests/
```

## Disclaimer

If you plan to use **Spleeter** on copyrighted material, make sure you get proper authorization from right owners beforehand.

## Troubleshooting

**Spleeter** is a complex piece of software and although we continuously try to improve and test it you may encounter unexpected issues running it. If that's the case please check the [FAQ page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/5.-FAQ) first as well as the list of [currently open issues](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues)

### Windows users

   It appears that sometimes the shortcut command `spleeter` does not work properly on windows. This is a known issue that we will hopefully fix soon. In the meantime replace `spleeter separate` by `python -m spleeter separate` in command line and it should work.
